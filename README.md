OneLiners
=========

A collection of various one line (or close to) programs. Usually hastily wrote, ugly, and
with limited/no error checking. Despite this, I'm still unusually proud of
these. While formatting now may not be one line, they all started as a single line in a
shell somewhere somehow, either from boredom, random inspiration, or need of a challenge.

Files:
------

* cpu_usage.sh
    * Mostly awk parsing out /proc/stat
* traceroute.sh <domain/ip> <max hops>
    * Mostly awk parsing sequential pings
* encode.py (import into python shell and use function)
    * does a basic example of lzma encryption (inspired by a class assignment, just does it in a single line function)
